# ChaosAssetManager

ChaosAssetManager is a tool built around [dalib](https://github.com/Sichii/dalib) that lets you interact with the dat
files. It also contains several useful editors for manipulating images, metadata, and more.

If the functionality you need is not present, feel free to make a request. Alternatively, you could use dalib directly.
Dalib has far more functionality than what is presented in this application.

## Usage

Clone the [ChaosAssetManager](https://github.com/Sichii/ChaosAssetManager) repo  
Also clone the [dalib](https://github.com/Sichii/dalib) repo

They must be cloned into the same directory, like so:

<pre>
📂sichii
 ┣📂ChaosAssetManager
 ┃ ┗📄ChaosAssetManager.sln
 ┗📂dalib
   ┗📄dalib.sln
</pre>

Alternatively, clone them wherever you want and fix the reference to dalib in the ChaosAssetManager project.
